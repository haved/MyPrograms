A collection of programs made by me

### Emacs server indicator
A python script with an app indicator for showing the status of and launching/stopping an Emacs server. Can automatically start a server and will change color once the server is ready for clients. Useful for restarting the server after changes to Emacs files. (Warning: Ugly code, multi-threaded python, pings Emacs every 5 seconds if you ask it to)

### Demographics Sim
A tiny GUI with graphs showing population distribution. Not good for much, really
